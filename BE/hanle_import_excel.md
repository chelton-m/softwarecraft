# **Understanding Excel's Date System: Why `datetime(1899, 12, 30)`?**

## ‚úÖ Excel's Serial Date System
Excel stores dates as **serial numbers**, where:
- `1` = **January 1, 1900**
- `2` = **January 2, 1900**
- `3` = **January 3, 1900**
- `46011` = **May 22, 2025** (but Excel is **off by one day**, explained below)

However, if `1` represents **January 1, 1900**, shouldn't we start from `1900-01-01`? ü§î

## ü§Ø The Unexpected Twist
Excel mistakenly assumes **1900 was a leap year** (it wasn‚Äôt).  
Leap years skip **every 100 years unless divisible by 400**‚Äîmeaning **1900 was NOT a leap year**.

This bug was introduced in early versions of Excel to maintain **compatibility with Lotus 1-2-3**.

### **Effects of the Bug**
- Excel **incorrectly inserts a fake date**: **February 29, 1900** (which never existed).
- This shifts **all subsequent dates forward by +1 day**.
- As a result, the **true zero date** for Excel should be:
  ```python
  datetime(1899, 12, 30)

## ‚úÖ Visual Breakdown: Excel's Date System  
Excel uses a **serial number system** for dates, where:  
- `1` = **January 1, 1900**  
- `60` = **February 29, 1900** (invalid in real life ‚ùå)  
- `61` = **March 1, 1900** (correct again ‚úÖ)

However, due to an **Excel bug**, all dates are shifted by **+1 day** after **February 28, 1900**.

### **Corrected Date Calculation**  

| **Excel Serial** | **Intended Date** | **Actual Output (Using `1899-12-30` Base)** |
|----------------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| `1` | January 1, 1900 | `1899-12-31 + 1` ‚Üí ‚úÖ **Correct** |
| `60` | February 29, 1900 | ‚ùå **Fake leap year (invalid)** |
| `61` | March 1, 1900 | ‚úÖ **Becomes correct again** |

### ‚úÖ **Solution: Fixing Date Conversion in Python**  
To adjust for Excel‚Äôs date system, use the following Python logic:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Convert Excel serial number to correct date
correct_date = datetime(1899, 12, 30) + timedelta(days=serial_number)
