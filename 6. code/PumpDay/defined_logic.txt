*** General Formulas Calculation
0. Remaininig Day 1stcal: remaininig_day_1stcal = (target_day - day_with_created_target).days()
1. Daily Progress Percentage: daily_progress = (actual_result/daily_target)*100
2. Total Effort Completion: total_progress = (actual_result/total_target)*100
3. Recal the daily_target if change daily_progress and keep the time: daily_target_recal = (total_target-daily_target*)/(target_day - day_with_change)
4. Recal the remaining_day if change daily_progress and keep the old_daily_target: remaining_day_recal = (total_target/old_daily_target)*365

To calculate progress and adjust targets dynamically based on actual performance, we'll use formulas for:

Daily Target Progress: How much of the daily goal was achieved.
Effort Impact on Total Target: How the real-life effort affects the total goal and the remaining time.
Adjusted Daily Target: A recalculated daily target to stay on track if the performance lags.

Features:
1. Calculate the targets change -> Prediction for many changes
2. 


First Time: Username, new target, following activities
Track history change
enter the target 


Next Time 
- Keep the session
