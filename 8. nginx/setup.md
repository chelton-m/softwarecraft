1. Install Nginx
If you havenâ€™t already:
Apply to Dockerfile.p...

2. Start Nginx
Apply to Dockerfile.p...
By default, Nginx config is at /opt/homebrew/etc/nginx/nginx.conf and serves on port 8080.

3. Configure Nginx for Django (Gunicorn/Uvicorn/other WSGI/ASGI server)
Assuming your Django app runs on localhost:8000 (adjust if different):
Edit the config:
Apply to Dockerfile.p...
conf
Add a server block like this (replace /Users/henrymai/Chelton/delta/JTS/static/ with your actual static root if different):
Apply to Dockerfile.p...

4. Reload Nginx
Apply to Dockerfile.p...
nginx
or
Apply to Dockerfile.p...

5. Run your Django app
If using Gunicorn:
Apply to Dockerfile.p...

Or for ASGI (Daphne/Uvicorn):
Apply to Dockerfile.p...

6. Test
Visit http://localhost/ in your browser.
Static files should be served by Nginx, and all other requests proxied to Django.


1. Directory Structure
You should have something like:
Apply to Dockerfile.p...
yml
2. nginx.conf Example
Create nginx/nginx.conf:
Apply to Dockerfile.p...
}
3. Dockerfile for Django
Example Dockerfile (in your project root or /JTS):
Apply to Dockerfile.p...
]
4. docker-compose.yml
Example:
Apply to Dockerfile.p...
:
5. How it works
Django runs in the web service, serving on port 8000.
Nginx runs in the nginx service, serving on port 80, and proxies requests to Django.
Static and media files are shared between the containers using Docker volumes.
6. Start Everything
From your project root:
Apply to Dockerfile.p...
build
docker-compose up --build

1. Dockerfile
Purpose:
Defines how to build the Docker image for your Django application.
What it does:
Starts from a Python base image.
Installs system dependencies (like PostgreSQL client, build tools).
Copies your Django project code into the image.
Installs Python dependencies from requirements.txt.
Collects static files (so Nginx can serve them).
Sets the default command to run your Django app with Gunicorn (a production-ready WSGI server).
Why?
This file ensures your Django app runs the same way everywhere, with all dependencies included, isolated from your host system.
2. nginx.conf
Purpose:
Configures Nginx, a high-performance web server, to:
Serve static and media files directly (fast!).
Proxy all other requests to your Django app.
What it does:
Listens on port 80 (HTTP).
Serves /static/ and /media/ files directly from shared Docker volumes.
Forwards all other requests to the Django app running in the web container.
Why?
Nginx is much better at serving static files and handling web traffic than Gunicorn or Django alone. It also acts as a reverse proxy, hiding your app server and providing an extra layer of security and performance.
3. docker-compose.yml
Purpose:
Defines and runs multi-container Docker applications.
What it does:
Describes three services:
web: Your Django app (built from the Dockerfile).
db: A PostgreSQL database (using the official image).
nginx: The Nginx web server (using the official image and your config).
Sets up shared volumes for static and media files so both Django and Nginx can access them.
Connects all services on a private Docker network.
Maps ports so you can access your app from your browser.
Why?
docker-compose.yml lets you start your entire stack (Django, database, Nginx) with a single command, and ensures all services can talk to each other.


How the Flow Works
You run:
docker-compose up --build
Docker Compose:
Builds the Django app image using the Dockerfile.
Starts the PostgreSQL database.
Starts the Django app (web service), which connects to the database and collects static files.
Starts Nginx (nginx service), which uses your nginx.conf to serve static/media files and proxy requests to Django.
User requests:
When you visit http://localhost/, Nginx receives the request.
If the request is for a static or media file, Nginx serves it directly from the shared volume.
Otherwise, Nginx forwards the request to the Django app (via Gunicorn) in the web container.
Django processes the request, possibly talks to the database, and returns a response to Nginx, which then sends it to the user.

Why is this powerful?
Isolation: Each service runs in its own container, so dependencies never conflict.
Reproducibility: The whole stack can be started on any machine with Docker, no manual setup.
Performance: Nginx serves static files and proxies requests efficiently.
Scalability: You can scale any service (e.g., multiple Django containers) easily.
Security: Nginx can handle HTTPS, rate limiting, etc., protecting your app.
